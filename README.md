Test project for detecting mutant DNA, requested by **Mercadolibre**. 

* [Live demo](https://meli-mutants-test.herokuapp.com)

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [Espa√±ol](README.es.md).*
 
### Getting started

Post a [JSON DNA sequence](#samples) to the **/mutants/** service on the [live demo](https://meli-mutants-test.herokuapp.com) using your favorite tool.

The input JSON format should be like this (NxN):  
```
{
  "dna": ["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATGT","AGAAGG","CCCCTA","TCACTG"]
}
```
*Remember to set ```Content-Type: application/json``` on the header of the POST request.*

The response of the service will tell you whether the DNA belongs to a mutant or not.

Then check the **/stats/** service in order to see the statistics of DNA verifications.

Post as many samples as you want, considering the [restrictions](#restrictions).

#### Available features

| Feature      | Description                                                   | Method       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| /mutant/     | Detects if the DNA sequence in the JSON belongs to a mutant   |     POST     |
| /stats/      | Returns a JSON with the statistics of the DNA checks          |     GET      |

### Samples
This project contains some JSON files with [sample with DNA sequences](https://github.com/florenciadiaz/mutants/tree/master/src/test/resources/samples/integration) to try on the [live demo](https://meli-mutants-test.herokuapp.com). 

### Restrictions
Since this is a sample application, the [live demo](https://meli-mutants-test.herokuapp.com) only processes DNA sequences of 51x51 maximum.

If you need bigger sequences (up to 180x180), you can download the source code and deploy locally or in a server with H2 database support, 
changing the key ```app.detection.max-nb-sequence-length=32767``` on the `application-[env].properties` file, where _[env]_ is related to the environment used.
